##faster_hexdig 

What are some fast ways of checking for lowercase hexadecimal digits?

There's a choice here that can be slightly bothersome, which is the idea of warming up
a system before taking a time measurement.  All of the methods here are linear, so there's a
hope that they way they perform hot is comparable to the way they perform cold.  This isn't true,
but maybe the simplification is useful.
